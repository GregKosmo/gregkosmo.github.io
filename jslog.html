          There's a reason this is the first listed project on my home page, it's the closest thing to a complete project I have
          (and one I actually use somewhat frequently). Domain: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jslog.dev">jslog.dev</a>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I created this project back in 2018 or 2019 at my first job, I wanted a quick way to test the behavior of JavaScript
            and share it with my coworkers. This was during the time of my obsession with PWAs and client-side offline apps, a
            theme you may notice through the rest of the projects. It started out as a textarea and two buttons but has
            gone through a few iterations over the years as I've added styling, more features, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its current state, Firefox does not play well with the input event capturing/overriding I'm doing as evidenced
            by the GitHub issues I have open. It also takes the concept of shifting responsibility to the client to a whole
            new level. Not only does all the code run on the client, but any shared code snippet's storage is shifted to the client too.
            It's the ultimate distributed database, infinite redundancy. Let Apple store the snippet in their iMessage database,
            let Microsoft store it in a Teams thread, let any website who uses the embed feature store it in the contents of their webpage.
            All through a revolutionary technology called URL and base64 encoding the contents of a textarea and appending it to the URL.
            Gross? Sure. Does it work? Yeah. Keep your snippets short, people.
